		<p style="color:black">Smart Calculator stores generated chart files in external devices, e.g. SD card. When Smart Calculator starts, it checks if its chart folder is available. If not, it tries to create its folder in the first external storage device. If unsuccessful, an error message will be shown. The path of the folder can be seen in settings view.</p>
		<p style="color:black">User can view and manage generated chart files using an internal file manager tool. In file manager, user can select a chart by clicking its icon. If a file is selected, its background color turns to orange. User can open a file by long-clicking its icon or select the item first then click "open" menu. User can also delete or rename a selected file or folder using "delete" or "rename" menu.</p>
