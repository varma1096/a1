		<p style="color:black;">Note that this functionality is still at beta stage. Only simple expressions can be recognized. Currently supported characters include numbers, selected simple English letters i.e. x, y, z, a, b, c, e, etc, and some special characters e.g. π, Σ, Π. Supported expression types are 1. Addition; 2. Subtraction; 3. Multiplication; 4. Division; 5. Fractions; 6. Roots; 7. Polynomials; 8. Exponents; 9. Algebra; 10. Integration; 11. Summation (Σ); and 12. Product (Π). And recognition accuracy is still low.
