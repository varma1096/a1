# SmartMath
An Android calculator app for math image recognition. It is able to take photo of math formula and recongize it. It calls the CoreMathImgProc lib.

This app is built by Android Studio (2.3.3). To build it, the source repository has to be placed in the same folder as CoreMathImgProc source repository. Moreover, CoreMathImgProc has to be built first. After the CoreMathImgProc.jar is created, developer can start to make/build this project using Android Studio.

To use this app, tap the camera button when the calculator starts, then focus mobile's camera on the formula to recognize, then press read, calculate or plot button. If read, formula will be only recognized. If calculate, formula will be recognized first and then calculated. If plot, formula will be recognized and plotted.

Please note that the CoreMathImgProc is still under development. I don't have enough math formula images to train it. And I also don't have enough time to improve the accuracy. Contribution from others are very much welcomed.

Also note that everything is written by JAVA. The pro is it is compatiable with most of devices. The con is it is slow.

If you want to use CoreMathImgProc lib in your app, or you want to develop your own app based on SmartMath, please recognize it when your app starts. Also, please make contribution to the CoreMathImgProc lib and SmartMath during your development. Thanks.
